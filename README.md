This repository contains code for "Color detection in python with computer vision". I have made the code in such a way that , if you give the BGR values , yopur camera will make a bounding box on objects having the particular BGR color that you have given as input.

#installing the libraries
with the requirements.txh file "pip install -r requirements.txt" in your terminal to install the libraries

#utils.py
This has the code to get the upper and lower limits for a particular colour
